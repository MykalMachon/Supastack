# Supastack

a minimal blogging platform based on supabase

## Background

This project is part of my term project for COMP 430 - Advanced Database Concepts at UFV.

**To be specific**, my term project consists of a database focussed tutorial with both written and video portions- This app highlights the database we create in the tutorial using Supabase as a DBMS.

## Documentation

If you want to setup your own Supastack instance, see [this tutorial document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MfqTH5ndbGTKz7lMd6zHLHDPXbyHDDIL3BUnXKkkWCk/edit?usp=sharing) as well as [this video](https://youtu.be/EMeq6feDJWQ) that goes over all the steps to set up supastack & deploy the app!
