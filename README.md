# Supastack
a minimal blogging platform based on supabase

## Background
This project is part of my term project for COMP 430 - Advanced Database Concepts at UFV. 

**To be specific**, my term project consists of a database focussed tutorial with both written and video portions- This app highlights the database we create in the tutorial using Supabase as a DBMS.
