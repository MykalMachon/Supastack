# Supastack

a minimal blogging platform based on supabase

## Background

This project is part of my term project for COMP 430 - Advanced Database Concepts at UFV.

**To be specific**, my term project consists of a database focussed tutorial with both written and video portions- This app highlights the database we create in the tutorial using Supabase as a DBMS.

## Documentation

If you want to setup your own Supastack instance, see the numbered markdown files in the `/docs/` folder. **Read the docs in order, if you follow the instructions in each file and you should be good to go!**
