## Connecting Supabase to Supastack

### Cloning The Project

I've created a project that works with this database & the supabase system. It's hosted on github and we can use Git to fork, and then clone it from this URL: https://github.com/MykalMachon/Supastack

1. Fork Supastack: You can click the "fork" button at the top of the repo to fork my repository. Now you should be able to clone your own version to your machine

2. Clone Supastack locally & install deps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Supastack
# wait for github to clone the repok
cd ./Supastack
# install dependencies
npm install

```

3. Setup environment
4. Run your app
